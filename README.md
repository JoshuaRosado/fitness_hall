This is a project created to help people in the gym fitness world who have very little experience or zero experience.
You don't have to be insecure or intimidated by the fact you don't know anything about workouts. 
Here you can look up routines from other people and search them by experience level, goals, how many days they go to the gym a week and read their routine.
For those who do not understand the workouts by name there's a section created called "Tutorials" so people can watch different kinds of videos of workouts.
In this page of the website users can look up what kind of workouts they want to learn and is divided by sections, which each section is a different muscle.
Also for people that do have experience there's a side of the website that you can share you knowledge and help people with your experience. Where experienced users can share their workouts and tips, while filling up the information on what kind of experience level they have, what are their goals and how many days they workout during the week. 
This is created for those people that are intimidated, have been bullied in the gym fitness world by others with experience, for those who want to start but don't know where to start or how to do a workout and even for people wo are experienced and are looking for more information and knowledge to improve their daily section of workouts. 

This is a project created to join the people from the GYM FITNESS community and people who are trying to join the community but don't have the experience or knowledge. Joining every person from different backgrounds and helping one another to grow as a community.
